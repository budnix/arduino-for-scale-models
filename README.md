# Arduino Scripts for Scale Models

This repository contains Arduino scripts, which can be used to enhance your car scale models.

## Installation

Use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to compile and send the script to the Arduino device.

_All scripts are tested on Arduino Mini Pro_

Each script by default uses an IR sensor to be able to control the lights remotely.
