# Arduino Scripts for Scale Models

This repository contains Arduino scripts, which can be used to enhance your car scale models.

## Installation

Use the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to compile and send the script to the Arduino device.

_All scripts are tested on Arduino Mini Pro_

Each script by default uses an IR sensor to be able to control the lights remotely. Hence the [IRRemote](https://github.com/z3t0/Arduino-IRremote) library has to be installed to compile the scripts.

List of the scripts:
 * [Ford Mustang lights](https://github.com/budnix/arduino-for-scale-models/tree/main/ford-mustang-lights)
 * [General lights](https://github.com/budnix/arduino-for-scale-models/tree/main/general-lights)
